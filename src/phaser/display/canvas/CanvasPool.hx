/**
 * The CanvasPool is a global static object, that allows Phaser to recycle and pool 2D Context Canvas DOM elements.
 * It does not pool WebGL Contexts, because once the context options are set they cannot be modified again,
 * which is useless for some of the Phaser pipelines / renderer.
 *
 * This singleton is instantiated as soon as Phaser loads, before a Phaser.Game instance has even been created.
 * Which means all instances of Phaser Games on the same page can share the one single pool.
 *
 * @namespace Phaser.Display.Canvas.CanvasPool
