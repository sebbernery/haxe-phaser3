     * During rendering for each letter of the text is rendered to the display, proportionally spaced out and aligned to
     * match the font structure.
     *
     * Dynamic Bitmap Text objects are different from Static Bitmap Text in that they invoke a callback for each
     * letter being rendered during the render pass. This callback allows you to manipulate the properties of
     * each letter being rendered, such as its position, scale or tint, allowing you to create interesting effects
     * like jiggling text, which can't be done with Static text. This means that Dynamic Text takes more processing
     * time, so only use them if you require the callback ability they have.
     *
     * BitmapText objects are less flexible than Text objects, in that they have less features such as shadows, fills and the ability
     * to use Web Fonts, however you trade this flexibility for rendering speed. You can also create visually compelling BitmapTexts by
     * processing the font texture in an image editor, applying fills and any other effects required.
     *
     * To create multi-line text insert \r, \n or \r\n escape codes into the text string.

     * DOM Element Game Objects are a way to control and manipulate HTML Elements over the top of your game.
     *
     * In order for DOM Elements to display you have to enable them by adding the following to your game
     * configuration object:
     *
     * ```javascript
     * dom {
     *   createContainer: true
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * When this is added, Phaser will automatically create a DOM Container div that is positioned over the top
     * of the game canvas. This div is sized to match the canvas, and if the canvas size changes, as a result of
     * settings within the Scale Manager, the dom container is resized accordingly.
     *
     * You can create a DOM Element by either passing in DOMStrings, or by passing in a reference to an existing
     * Element that you wish to be placed under the control of Phaser. For example:
     *
     * ```javascript
     * this.add.dom(x, y, 'div', 'background-color: lime; width: 220px; height: 100px; font: 48px Arial', 'Phaser');
     * ```
     *
     * The above code will insert a div element into the DOM Container at the given x/y coordinate. The DOMString in
     * the 4th argument sets the initial CSS style of the div and the final argument is the inner text. In this case,
     * it will create a lime colored div that is 220px by 100px in size with the text Phaser in it, in an Arial font.
     *
     * You should nearly always, without exception, use explicitly sized HTML Elements, in order to fully control
     * alignment and positioning of the elements next to regular game content.
     *
     * Rather than specify the CSS and HTML directly you can use the `load.html` File Loader to load it into the
     * cache and then use the `createFromCache` method instead. You can also use `createFromHTML` and various other
     * methods available in this class to help construct your elements.
     *
     * Once the element has been created you can then control it like you would any other Game Object. You can set its
     * position, scale, rotation, alpha and other properties. It will move as the main Scene Camera moves and be clipped
     * at the edge of the canvas. It's important to remember some limitations of DOM Elements: The obvious one is that
     * they appear above or below your game canvas. You cannot blend them into the display list, meaning you cannot have
     * a DOM Element, then a Sprite, then another DOM Element behind it.
     *
     * They also cannot be enabled for input. To do that, you have to use the `addListener` method to add native event
     * listeners directly. The final limitation is to do with cameras. The DOM Container is sized to match the game canvas
     * entirely and clipped accordingly. DOM Elements respect camera scrolling and scrollFactor settings, but if you
     * change the size of the camera so it no longer matches the size of the canvas, they won't be clipped accordingly.
     *
     * Also, all DOM Elements are inserted into the same DOM Container, regardless of which Scene they are created in.
     *
     * DOM Elements are a powerful way to align native HTML with your Phaser Game Objects. For example, you can insert
     * a login form for a multiplayer game directly into your title screen. Or a text input box for a highscore table.
     * Or a banner ad from a 3rd party service. Or perhaps you'd like to use them for high resolution text display and
     * UI. The choice is up to you, just remember that you're dealing with standard HTML and CSS floating over the top
     * of your game, and should treat it accordingly.

     * Creates a new Point Light Game Object and adds it to the Scene.
     *
     * Note: This method will only be available if the Point Light Game Object has been built into Phaser.
     *
     * The Point Light Game Object provides a way to add a point light effect into your game,
     * without the expensive shader processing requirements of the traditional Light Game Object.
     *
     * The difference is that the Point Light renders using a custom shader, designed to give the
     * impression of a point light source, of variable radius, intensity and color, in your game.
     * However, unlike the Light Game Object, it does not impact any other Game Objects, or use their
     * normal maps for calcuations. This makes them extremely fast to render compared to Lights
     * and perfect for special effects, such as flickering torches or muzzle flashes.
     *
     * For maximum performance you should batch Point Light Game Objects together. This means
     * ensuring they follow each other consecutively on the display list. Ideally, use a Layer
     * Game Object and then add just Point Lights to it, so that it can batch together the rendering
     * of the lights. You don't _have_ to do this, and if you've only a handful of Point Lights in
     * your game then it's perfectly safe to mix them into the dislay list as normal. However, if
     * you're using a large number of them, please consider how they are mixed into the display list.
     *
     * The renderer will automatically cull Point Lights. Those with a radius that does not intersect
     * with the Camera will be skipped in the rendering list. This happens automatically and the
     * culled state is refreshed every frame, for every camera.
     *
     * The origin of a Point Light is always 0.5 and it cannot be changed.

     * Creates a new Text Game Object and adds it to the Scene.
     *
     * A Text Game Object.
     *
     * Text objects work by creating their own internal hidden Canvas and then renders text to it using
     * the standard Canvas `fillText` API. It then creates a texture from this canvas which is rendered
     * to your game during the render pass.
     *
     * Because it uses the Canvas API you can take advantage of all the features this offers, such as
     * applying gradient fills to the text, or strokes, shadows and more. You can also use custom fonts
     * loaded externally, such as Google or TypeKit Web fonts.
     *
     * You can only display fonts that are currently loaded and available to the browser: therefore fonts must
     * be pre-loaded. Phaser does not do ths for you, so you will require the use of a 3rd party font loader,
     * or have the fonts ready available in the CSS on the page in which your Phaser game resides.
     *
     * See {@link http://www.jordanm.co.uk/tinytype this compatibility table} for the available default fonts
     * across mobile browsers.
     *
     * A note on performance: Every time the contents of a Text object changes, i.e. changing the text being
     * displayed, or the style of the text, it needs to remake the Text canvas, and if on WebGL, re-upload the
     * new texture to the GPU. This can be an expensive operation if used often, or with large quantities of
     * Text objects in your game. If you run into performance issues you would be better off using Bitmap Text
     * instead, as it benefits from batching and avoids expensive Canvas API calls.
